# Remote-Controlled Stair-Climbing Robot

## Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation details for a **Remote-Controlled Stair-Climbing Robot**. The robot employs a **Rocker-Bogie Suspension Mechanism** inspired by NASA's Mars Rovers, enabling it to climb stairs and traverse rugged terrains effectively. It is controlled via Bluetooth and built using economical and readily available components.

## Features
- Stair-climbing capability using the **Rocker-Bogie mechanism**.
- Remote control via **Bluetooth**.
- High maneuverability and mobility.
- Lightweight, cost-effective design using **MDF sheets**.

## Objectives
1. Develop a scaled-down version of a remote-controlled rover.
2. Ensure cost efficiency and ease of assembly.
3. Provide high mobility and stability.
4. Enable the robot to carry light weights quickly and effectively.

## Components
- **Arduino UNO**: Microcontroller unit.
- **Motor Driver (L298N)**: Controls motor operations.
- **Bluetooth Module (HC-05)**: Enables wireless control.
- **BO Motors**: Provide movement and climbing capabilities.
- **Power Source**: 7.9V DC supply.
- **MDF Sheets**: Lightweight and rigid body material.

## Design Details
### Rocker-Bogie Suspension Mechanism
- Ensures all wheels maintain contact with uneven surfaces.
- Provides excellent stability and mobility.

### CAD Model
- Designed based on the model provided by [THESTEMPEDIA](https://thestempedia.com/project/diy-stair-climbing-robot/).

## Working Principle
The robot climbs stairs by leveraging the **Rocker-Bogie suspension system**, where:
1. The front wheels push against the rear wheels to lift the rover.
2. Subsequent pairs of wheels climb the obstacle in a step-by-step process.
3. The entire rover stabilizes and continues moving forward.

## Future Enhancements
- Use of sturdier materials for improved durability.
- Integration of larger wheels for better obstacle scaling.
- Upgrading to high-torque motors for enhanced performance.
- Automation and obstacle-avoidance features using advanced sensors.
